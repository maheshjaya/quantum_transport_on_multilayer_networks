# Quantum Walks on Multilayer Networks

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of **Discrete-Time Quantum Walks (DTQW)** on multilayer networks. The project explores quantum transport dynamics on complex network structures, including the effects of different coin operators and decoherence mechanisms.

## 🔬 Quantum Walk Models

We investigate discrete-time quantum walks using the following coin operators:

- **Fourier Coin Operator**
- **Grover Coin Operator**

These operators are used to study how internal coin dynamics influence quantum transport on multilayer network structures.

## 📊 Analysis and Measurements

The study focuses on analyzing:

- **Probability distribution over network nodes**
- **Return probability**
- **Time-averaged probability distribution**
- **Effects of decoherence (Broken-Links Model)**

The decoherence model introduces structural noise by randomly breaking links, allowing us to examine the transition from quantum to classical transport behavior.
